How to get Windows 10/11 HEVC and HEIF (High Efficiency Video/Image) extensions for free

If you edit videos and images on your Windows Machine, these two extensions will come in handy (especially if you import from your phone).

Both of these codeces/extensions are designed to contain high efficiency files (images and videos respectively).

HEVC is normally a paid extension ($0.99) from the Microsoft Store, due to licensing agreements. But you can get it for free and legally [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/hevc-video-extensions-from-device-manufacturer/9N4WGH0Z6VHQ). This is meant for OEMS to pre-install on most PCs (since they paid the license fee previously). Alternatively, VLC should be able to play a video of this type without any additional plugins.

HEIF, on the other hand, is completely free and can be installed [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/heif-image-extensions/9PMMSR1CGPWG).

Now you can enable these formats on your Android or iPhone and send them to your PC to check!
